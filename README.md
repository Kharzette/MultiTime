# MultiTime
Experimenting with the newish Unity netcode stuff.

I'm making this on Linux, and slowly going blind from the lack of font scaling.

I'm using steamworks as a basic auth so I don't have to mess with any kind of login.

I haven't paid for it though so it shows up as the generic "spacewar".

I'm using nuget package "Unity3D" that gives some great csproj variables for the code editor to have good intellisense and such.  I'm using VSCode.  Github page is here:  https://github.com/Rabadash8820/UnityAssemblies

For debugging, the VSCode official debugger is busted / abandoned, but there's a fork that works at https://github.com/giorgospetkakis/vscode-unity-debug

Big thanks to them, I had whipped out wireshark and was starting on a new debugger from scratch.  That would have taken awhile.
