Gameplay
	Tab targeting with defensive target for other players or friendly npcs
	Combat
		Combat rounds will probably be 2 seconds standard, with haste/weapon speed reducing that
		Weapon switches incur a time penalty
		Limited readied abilities
		Ability usage should flow and be natural with no UI at all
		Predictable cooldowns so no need to stare at an interface
		Reactive abilties so it isn't just 123 123 123 over and over
			DAOC did this well with evade/parry/block reactives
	Groups, 4-8, haven't decided on group size yet
	Health / Endurance / Mana type system, not sure of the names yet
	SWG style wounds to pools
	Death
		Dead players lie where they died
		enemies may take items from the corpse
		Friendlies can carry a dead player
		May be locations to resurrect dead players
		Spells or rituals can resurrect
		Death causes heavy wounding
		Dead players can still chat but the longer they are dead the more garbled and faint the text becomes
	Enemy areas
		Places where enemies live will usually be tiered
		Enemies will come from the areas in the next tier up
		Dead enemies will not respawn, but organize into parties and move back in together from the higher tier area
		Holding enemy areas will slowly ramp up the difficulty and rewards
	Magic
		All magic is divine and comes from outside entities
		Most spells can be channeled, this changes it into a constant stream effect
	Melee Abilities
